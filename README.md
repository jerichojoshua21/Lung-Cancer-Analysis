**Project Overview**

This project aims to analyze and predict lung cancer cases through data-driven approaches, leveraging machine learning and visualization techniques. By examining key factors such as smoking history, age, cancer stage, and survival duration, the study develops predictive models and extracts meaningful insights. These findings support early diagnosis efforts and enhance treatment strategies for improved patient outcomes.

**Tools & Technologies Utilized**

MySQL – Employed for efficient data storage, retrieval, and analytical querying.

Power BI – Utilized to create dynamic visualizations and interactive dashboards for insightful reporting.

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Applied within Power BI to develop calculated columns and measures for deeper analytical insights.



**Project Objective**

Develop predictive models to assess the probability of lung cancer based on multiple risk factors.

Examine survival trends, the impact of smoking, and the effectiveness of different treatments.

Generate data-driven insights to support healthcare professionals in making well-informed clinical decisions.
